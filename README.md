### Overview

NatureVigil is an innovative biodiversity conservation initiative that leverages machine learning models and community engagement to protect ecosystems. By integrating AI-driven monitoring tools with a gamified platform, we empower individuals to contribute meaningfully to environmental sustainability.

### Features

#### AI-Powered Monitoring Tools

- **Species Classifier**: Identifies endangered species from images to combat poaching and habitat loss.
- **Forest Health Predictor**: Analyzes factors like tribal population growth and industrial expansion to forecast deforestation hotspots over time.
- **Extinction Risk Analyzer**: Predicts survival odds for wildlife using factors like invasive species and human encroachment.
- **Aquatic Ecosystem Monitor**: Tracks water health (pH, temperature, pollutants) to safeguard marine life.

#### Eco-Connect: The People’s Movement

- **Gamified Platform**: Students and colleges earn *Green Coins* for eco-friendly actions like planting trees or adopting solar energy.
- **Academic Rewards**: Redeem coins for academic credits or rank on leaderboards—making sustainability a shared mission.
- **Global Biodiversity Insights**: Share stories, track global biodiversity metrics, and learn through interactive maps.

### Use Cases

- **Researchers**: Access real-time species data and predictive analytics.
- **Students**: Turn eco-actions into academic rewards.
- **Policymakers**: Utilize precision tools to enforce conservation laws.
